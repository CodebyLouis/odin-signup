My take on The Odin Project's Sign-Up Form assignment, featuring a mountain theme with form validation.

## About

This is a responsive sign-up form for a fictional service called "Mounting". The project focuses on form validation, CSS pseudo-classes, and creating an elegant user interface with a mountainous background.

## What I Built

- Clean, centered form layout with glassmorphism effect
- Real-time form validation with visual feedback
- Custom password matching validation with JavaScript
- Focus states with smooth transitions and box-shadows
- Invalid input highlighting (red borders after interaction)
- Responsive input fields with proper HTML5 validation

## Technologies

- HTML5 (semantic forms, validation attributes)
- CSS3 (custom properties, pseudo-classes, glassmorphism)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event listeners)

## Validation Features

- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Password matching confirmation
- Required field validation
- Visual feedback only after user interaction (no red inputs on page load)
